Block-Braj
==========

* This was the first bigger-ish project I worked on.
* So, the code is pretty... very... shitty.
* It is an android game similar to the old Block Dude game for TI calculators.
* It is currently on the android play store at:
*     https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.schimpf.block.braj.free
*     AND
*     https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.schimpf.block.braj.pro
